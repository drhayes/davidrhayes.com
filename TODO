- get rid of bounding box
- different tiles move at different speeds
- queue up the set_content calls in some way (or set_content submits to queue) that is only polled every once in a while to serialize tile-to-content conversion
- instead of starting tiles at rest, fade them in as they are moving, maybe one-by-one at same speed as replies come in
- consider adding reflection of tiles at the bottom... might have to correct for perspective

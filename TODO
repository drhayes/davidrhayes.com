- consider adding reflection of tiles at the bottom... might have to correct for perspective
- add link to where I got the icons from: http://icondock.com
- sort the social stream by entry date
- there's this weird connection between tiles and content that doesn't need to be there... tiles can just be swirly things without knowing what content they'll eventually be once the queue finds another item to add. So the tile doesn't get content set, we just add an object to the queue and then the queue runner pulls that object off, pops all_tiles, and does the transform. Might work better that way.

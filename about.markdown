### About ###

I am a Turing machine wrangler living in Austin, TX.

For those who care about such things, this site is run using the excellent [jekyll][] project and hosted using the truly awesome [GitHub Pages][githubpages]. Everything you see here was typed by me into [TextMate][] and version controlled using [Git][]. When I can help it, I write text in the [Markdown][] format.

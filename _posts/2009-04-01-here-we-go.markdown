## Here We Go ##

Although my [Twitter][mytwitter] and [Tumblr][mytumblr] accounts are great for short-form communication, I've been itching to express myself in some longer form. I resisted for a long time because I feel the sum of my online output represents a lot of what I'm thinking about (that I'm willing to share) at any given moment. I'd even considered just making a site that captures all of that into some big lifestream... but, ultimately, there are times when a longer, more thoughtful essay is more appropriate.

### Layout ###

The layout isn't definite. I want to include my tattoo as a character in the layout as the final step. It would be nice to get commenting working as well.
